# Support Desk

This project is a work-in-progress ticketing tool built with the MERN stack.

## Structure

- **backend** – Express server with MongoDB via Mongoose
- **frontend** – React application (Vite)

## Getting Started

1. Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and adjust settings.
2. Install dependencies in each folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm install
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   node backend/server.js
   ```

Frontend scripts (Vite) will be added later.
